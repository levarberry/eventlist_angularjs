# eventlist_angularjs
My Generic AngularJS Template for An Event List Control.

If you happen to stumble across this code.   It probably doesn't work.   I copied it out of an existing project just to store the format.

I'll most likely revamp this to Angular 2+ one day.  BUT NOT TODAY! :)

Use this only to see how I did things .. don't just clone this repo.

There is a node server that serves the pages and allows the I/O with MongoDB.   I am now more of CouchDB fan, so expect the next version to be  Node/Couch/Angular
